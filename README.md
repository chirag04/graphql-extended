# graphql-ext

An extension of graphql-js that adds useful functionality for production graphql deployments.

# Introduction

## Back to the fundamentals

# Developing

This project is written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and requires the typescript compiler to build.

To develop this project locally clone & build the project.

1. `mkdir graphql-ext && cd graphql-ext`
2. `git clone https://github.com/scaphold/graphql-ext.git .`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run buildw`

This will start the typescript compiler and will watch for changes. If you want to build one time run `npm run build`
